# Tests for RegExp Unicode property escapes

This repository hosts a script that generates tests for [Unicode property escapes in ECMAScript regular expressions](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-regexp-unicode-property-escapes).

[The plan](https://github.com/tc39/test262/issues/950) is to update the script every time the Unicode Standard is updated (i.e. yearly) and to upstream its output to [Test262](https://github.com/tc39/test262).

## Generating the tests

Clone the repository, and then run:

```sh
npm install
npm run build
```

The `output` directory holds the generated test files, ready to be upstreamed to test262â€™s `test/built-ins/RegExp/property-escapes/` directory.
